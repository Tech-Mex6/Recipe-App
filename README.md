This is an Application that shows you a list of food categories presented in a table view, when you pick a category(Cell), it presents a list of meals under the chosen category. 

From that list you can pick a meal by selecting a cell and that in turn takes you to a detail view that shows you an image of the meal, instructions on how to prepare the meal and ingredients needed to prepare the meal.

This application's UI is entirely programmatic using AutoLayout.
